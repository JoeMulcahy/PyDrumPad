Known bugs and issues
-   sample editor:
    - start line doesn't align to actual starting position of sample
-   midi
    - changing the midi device after choosing an initial midi devices crashes application
        - suspected issue with threading, running thread no closing
-   audio channel
    - pan not behaving correctly. when panned left sounds like pan centered
-   audio engine

TO DO
    - sound engine - figure out the processing order of start, end, pitch, stretch
    - load preset: partially done. voice data not loading correctly
    - reduce midi latency

Nice to haves
    - load multiple samples on a single pad. Use note and velocity to trigger sample
    - sound fx
    - zoomable waveform in editor
    - if start > end -> reverse playback

Audio Engine tweaks
-   sound channel
    -   does voice have to be triggers here. Move trigger() to voice
    -   let audio channel accept a list of voices instead of just one
    -   add continuous voices (instead of fixed voices). Allows for realtime changes to voices
    -   changeable audio buffer in sound engine
    -   allow for user settings [buffer size, sample rate]
    -   aux channels

   Problems with the Sound Engine
   -
-   any voice changes requires
    - a new voice
    - replacing the voice in the audio channel
    - updating the audio channels in the sound engine

Ideas
    - mode to arrange pads like a keyboards
