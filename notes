TO DO
    - align sample start and end pos with sample view start and end
    - each sample in editor will need its own settings [start, end etc]
        - on pad change get [start, end etc] and update editor
    - if start > end -> reverse playback
    - add color to pads with samples
    - add file name to pads
    - implement pitch, stretch sample. Update sample view to reflect changes
    - separate logic from gui in drum_pads_module. move logic to drum_pad_app
    - reset
    - load preset (temp: load samples in folder to pads)
    - save preset
    - reduce midi latency

Nice to haves
    - load multiple samples on a single pad. Use note and velocity to trigger sample
    - sound fx
    - zoomable waveform in editor

Audio Engine tweaks
-   sound channel
    -   does voice have to be triggers here. Move trigger() to voice
    -   let audio channel accept a list of voices instead of just one
    -   add continuous voices (instead of fixed voices). Allows for realtime changes to voices
    -   changeable audio buffer in sound engine
    -   allow for user settings [buffer size, sample rate]
    -   aux channels

   Problems with the Sound Engine
-   any voice changes requires
    - a new voice
    - replacing the voice in the audio channel
    - updating the audio channels in the sound engine
