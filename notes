Known bugs and issues
-   pressing pads in quick succession crash sound engine


TO DO
    - sound engine - figure out the processing order of start, end, pitch, stretch
    - reset
    - load preset (temp: load samples in folder to pads)
    - save preset
    - reduce midi latency

Nice to haves
    - load multiple samples on a single pad. Use note and velocity to trigger sample
    - sound fx
    - zoomable waveform in editor
    - if start > end -> reverse playback

Audio Engine tweaks
-   sound channel
    -   does voice have to be triggers here. Move trigger() to voice
    -   let audio channel accept a list of voices instead of just one
    -   add continuous voices (instead of fixed voices). Allows for realtime changes to voices
    -   changeable audio buffer in sound engine
    -   allow for user settings [buffer size, sample rate]
    -   aux channels

   Problems with the Sound Engine
   -
-   any voice changes requires
    - a new voice
    - replacing the voice in the audio channel
    - updating the audio channels in the sound engine

Ideas
    - mode to arrange pads like a keyboards
