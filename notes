TO DO
    - load audio sample to pad
    - load samples on init
    - align sample start and end pos with sample view start and end
    - implement pitch, stretch sample. Update sample view to reflect changes
    - load preset
    - save preset
    - reduce midi latency

Nice to haves
    - load multiple samples on a single pad. Use note and velocity to trigger sample
    - sound fx

Audio Engine tweaks
-   sound channel
    -   does voice have to be triggers here. Move trigger() to voice
    -   let audio channel accept a list of voices instead of just one
    -   add continuous voices (instead of fixed voices). Allows for realtime changes to voices
    -   changeable audio buffer in sound engine
    -   allow for user settings [buffer size, sample rate]
    -   aux channels

Ideas
    - mode to arrange pads like a keyboards
